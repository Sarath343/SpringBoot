return ResponseEntity to set a new response

So many logs coming in the broser means dev tools are enabled.
Once dev tooils are disabled only few lines of errors will come 
In production devtools will be disabled by default.(even if dont comment in pom file)


To throw exception:
	throw new exceptioName() ; 
	in this exceptionname class @ResponseStatus(code=HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND) annotation etc can be given to the class

we can send normal successfull response object also in response entity i think 
anyways if its error we can modify the response structure using the above class
	
	
ResponseEntityExceptionHandler -> class responsible for all the spring exceptions
When an exception is thrown , the response entity is returned by the ResponseEntityExceptionHandler class.
There is a handleException method which will return the response entity in many cases.
We can override this methode to return response entity if our type back .
